This Project is an IoT Project to digitalise your doorbell.

It uses a sound sensor and reed switch.

The sound sensor is used to obtain the ring from the original doorbell (still operational as backup) and the reed switch noticed when the door is opened. Once the door opens the sound playing gets interrupted.

Additionally a TELEGRAM BOT will send you a message to you GSM to notify you when it has rang. Additioanlly it is already prepeared to use a WebCam to get a picture of the person when ringing.

But be aware that certain privacy laws may prohibit that function. 

This library is more a brinadump of my project thatn a real tuorial to greate an IoT doorbell.

A detailed wiring plan is still missing, but can be desolved by looking into the used GPIOs.
